# Industrial Engineering
Studies taken in USFQ from 2009 to 2014. 
Optimization of complex process and systems with different tools. The main focus within the career (or what I remember was important):
 - [[Operational Research]]: Numerical optimization of complex problems. 
 - [[Simulation]]: Usage of [[Statistics]] techniques to emulate certain process. Highly used in [[Queueing Theory]].
 - [[Design of Experiments]]: Experimental design to test certain features, including [[AB Testing]].
 - [[New Products Design]]: Process and methodologies for the design of new products in big scale.
 - [[Supply Chain Management]]: Logistic optimization methods [[Forecasting]] methods.
 - [[Quality Control]]: Application of Statistical methods for the quality assurance within a process, including [[Kanban]], [[Six Sigma]] and other continuous-improvement methodologies.
