# Graph Analytics:
Branch of mathematics that deals with network analysis. Networks are formed by the connection of nodes via links. For example, social networks are the connection of people (nodes) via relationships (links). Among the most important topics and algorithms, there are:

 - [[Page Rank]]
 - [[Graph Centrality]]
 - [[Connected Components]]
 - [[Minimum Spamming Tree]]
 - [[Graph Embeddedness]]
 - [[Graph Degree]]
 - [[Co-occurance]]

Among the easiest and most common usages there are:

 - [[Recommendation Systems]]
 - [[Shortest Path]]
 - [[Graph Neural Networks]]
 - [[Label Propagation]]
